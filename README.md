# Emotion-Based Music Recommendation App

## Overview
This application uses **facial expressions** and **text-based mood inputs** to recommend music that matches the user's emotional state. It combines AI-powered emotion detection with music recommendations from the Spotify API.

## Features
1. **Emotion Detection via Camera**:
   - Captures a 5-second live feed using the camera.
   - Detects emotions such as *anger*, *joy*, *sadness*, *fear*, etc., using DeepFace and OpenCV.

2. **Text-Based Emotion Analysis**:
   - Accepts user input in a text box to analyze emotions using Hugging Face Transformers.

3. **Spotify Music Recommendation**:
   - Recommends songs based on the user's mood using the Spotify API.
   - Leverages mood-related attributes like **valence** and **arousal** to fetch relevant tracks.

   - Sends mood data to the backend for analysis.

2. **Backend**:
   - Powered by **Flask** with the following features:
     - Detects emotions from camera frames using DeepFace.
     - Processes text input to classify mood using Hugging Face models.
     - Communicates with the Spotify API to recommend tracks.
   - Uses WebSocket for real-time emotion updates from the camera.

3. **Spotify Integration**:
   - The user is authenticated via Spotifyâ€™s OAuth flow.
   - Recommends music based on the detected emotion and its corresponding **valence** and **arousal** values.
